Hi, I'm Malachy McAvoy, a lifelong learner with a background in economics, data analytics, and machine learning. I'm passionate about leveraging data to uncover insights, build predictive models, and create impactful visualizations.

I graduated from SUNY Geneseo in 2022 with a degree in Economics and a minor in Data Analytics. After graduation, I worked at Epic Systems from January 2023 to March 2024 as a Project Manager, where I gained experience implementing Revenue Cycle-focused healthcare software. During my time at Epic, I worked with notable customers such as Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.

Outside of work, I’m an avid sports fan. Growing up, I played a variety of sports, including lacrosse, football, basketball, baseball, and soccer, and I continue to stay active whenever possible. I’m a die-hard fan of the New York Giants, Knicks, Yankees, and Rangers, as well as Notre Dame Football and Arsenal F.C. In my free time, I enjoy working out, running, playing golf, listening to podcasts, and watching stand-up comedy.

Feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out!
