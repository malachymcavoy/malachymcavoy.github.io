# Overview

For my project I have chosen to analyze if a football player's performance 
in college and at the NFL combine affects their success in the NFL. Front offices 
in the NFL spend months grueling over what players they believe are the best fit 
for their organization. Making the wrong selection could set a franchise back years 
from their ultimate goal of winning a super bowl. My main topics of exploratory analysis are:

* Which college teams/conferences produce:
    + the most first round picks?
    + the longest careers at each position?
    + the most successful careers at each position?
* What is the mean weighted career approximate value at each pick?
* What position has the lowest/highest mean draft position in the first round?
* How many players have been drafted in each round by position?
* Do college All-Americans have longer/more successful careers?

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
